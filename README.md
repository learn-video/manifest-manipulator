# Manifest Manipulator

Manifest Manipulator is a powerful tool designed to simplify the modification of video manifests. With this tool, you can easily filter video manifests based on bandwidth and frame rate, as well as set the desired manifest as the first one.

## Why?

Video content comes with its fair share of complexities. Certain video manifests may encounter compatibility issues with various devices due to factors such as frame rate, bitrate, or other tags that directly impact smooth playback.

The scenario depicted in the image above perfectly illustrates a common problem: devices incapable of playing videos at 60fps. To address this challenge, we introduce Manifest Manipulator â€” a solution designed to rewrite video manifests on the fly, just before delivering them to users.

## Features

* **Bandwidth Filtering**: Filter video manifests based on the desired minimum and maximum bandwidth. This allows you to select the appropriate video quality based on available devices. e.g some TVs don't play a too low bandwidth.

* **Frame Rate Filtering**: Filter video manifests based on the desired frame rate. You can specify the desired frame rate to ensure smooth playback on devices with different capabilities.

* **Set First Manifest**: Set a specific video manifest as the first one in the modified manifest. This feature is useful when you want to prioritize a particular video quality or adapt the manifest for specific player requirements. Players start playing from the first manifest.

* **Define Window Duration (DVR)**: This feature allows you to define the window duration (in seconds) for your video manifests. This feature enables precise control over the availability of video content within the manifest, limitig it when it is necessary.

## Demo

To demonstrate the functionality of the Video Manifest Modifier, we've set up a demo consisting of an HTML page with a video player. The demo involves two servers: one server hosting the HTML page and another server acting as a proxy to modify the manifest downloaded from the video HLS (HTTP Live Streaming).

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Player] -->|Requests video manifest| B(Proxy Server);
  B -->|Intercepts and modifies the manifest| C[Original Streaming];
  C -->|Applies modifications| B;
  B -->|Returns modified manifest| A;

```

Steps to reproduce:

* Go do `demo` folder
* Run `go run main.go`
* Browse http://localhost:8080
* Play it!
